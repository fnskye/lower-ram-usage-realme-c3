# Lower RAM Usage on Realme C3 (RMX2020)

This Magisk module optimizes Android's heap memory configuration to **reduce RAM usage** and improve **overall performance** on the **Realme C3 (RMX2020)**. It applies systemless tweaks that help with **smoother multitasking** and **better gaming experience**, especially on devices with limited memory.

## What Does It Do?

This module adjusts three key Android memory settings:

- `heapstartsize` – Sets the initial memory allocated to an app at launch
- `heapgrowthlimit` – Controls how much the heap is allowed to grow
- `heapsize` – Defines the maximum heap memory an app can use

These values are fine-tuned to limit excessive memory usage without breaking app performance.
